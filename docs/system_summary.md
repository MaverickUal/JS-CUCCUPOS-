# System Summary

CuccuPOS — a coffee-shop point-of-sale system for staff. This file describes **what the system does and the rules it obeys**. For code organisation see [`codebase_summary.md`](./codebase_summary.md). For the database schema and security rules see [`src/lib/firebase_structure.md`](./src/lib/firebase_structure.md).

---

## What it is

A single-page web app used by shop staff during trading hours. There is no customer-facing site and no server: customers are walk-ins who pay at the counter, so nobody outside the shop ever signs in.

Two staff roles:

| Role in DB | Shown as | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `cashier` | Cashier | Takes orders, records cash, sees only their own order history |
| `admin` | Owner/Manager | Everything: dashboard, orders, menu, cashiers, reports |

---

## The transaction

The core loop, and the only thing a cashier does all day:

1. **Build the order** — tap `+` on drinks. Sold-out items can't be added.
2. **Enter the cash received** — typed, or one tap from the quick amounts (Exact, ₱200, ₱500, ₱1,000).
3. **Review** — the checkout modal shows the total, the cash tendered, and **the change**, before anything is committed.
4. **Confirm** — the order lands as `pending` and the kitchen is notified.
5. **Owner/Manager advances it**: `pending → preparing → ready → completed`, or `cancelled`.

Order numbers are human-readable (`ORD-MVC26YJ9`) for reading across a counter. The change is repeated on the success screen — *"Return ₱195 change to the customer"* — so it can't be misread.

### Cash only

There is one payment method. The dropdown that used to offer GCash and Card is gone. Every order records `cashTendered` and `changeGiven`, which lets the owner reconcile the drawer at close:

```
Sales collected (cash)   ₱290
Less change given out    ₱0
Less refunds             ₱0
Net in drawer            ₱290
```

### Discounts

PWD and Senior Citizen concessions can be applied at checkout. The cashier selects
one; the screen then shows **subtotal → discount → total → cash → change** before
anything is committed. The order stores `subtotal`, `discountType`,
`discountAmount` and `total` so the arithmetic can be audited later.

> **The 20% rate is confirmed by statute; ID capture is not implemented.**
> RA 10754 Sec. 32(a)(1) grants PWD a discount of "at least twenty percent (20%)"
> explicitly covering "restaurants and recreation centers", and the IRR of RA 9442
> Sec. 6.1(b) extends it to a restaurant's "food drinks, beverages, dessert and
> other consumable items". RA 7432 Sec. 5(a), as amended by RA 9994 and restated in
> RA 11916, grants Senior Citizens the same 20%. So `DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.2` is a legal
> floor, not a guess — raising it is always allowed.
>
> What the law also requires and **this app does not do**: proof of entitlement.
> RA 10754 IRR Sec. 12 says sales records must carry the concession holder's name,
> ID number and TIN for the discount to be claimed as a tax deduction. The app
> records only the discount *type*; the cashier asserts eligibility. Collecting ID
> details is a privacy and policy decision for the owner, and until it is done the
> app must not be described as compliant. One discount per order is enforced, which
> satisfies the statutory ban on double-discounting a person who is both PWD and
> Senior Citizen. VAT is not modelled at all — that is separate BIR bookkeeping.

### Refunds

An Owner/Manager can refund an order fully or partially from the order details
dialog. The dialog shows the amount already refunded and the remaining refundable
balance, requires a reason, and asks for confirmation. Refunds cannot exceed what
was paid, duplicates are rejected, and the original order is never deleted.

Refunds are recorded **only after cash has actually been handed back** — the
write happens in a client SDK transaction on the order record, not optimistically
in the UI. Authorized Owner/Manager only.

---

## Screens

| Screen | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Sales/order/average for a chosen period, sales chart, best sellers, recent orders — filterable by cashier |
| **Orders** | Every order newest-first with status filters and search; advance status, cancel, view details, refund, print/export receipt |
| **Menu** | Add, edit, delete items; sold-out toggle; duplicate-name review |
| **Cashiers** | Every staff account with its role, order count and last order; create cashier accounts, disable access |
| **Reports** | Period report — gross / refunds / net, chart, category split, top items, refund audit, CSV export, print/PDF |
| **Order** (cashier) | Menu browse, cart with typed quantity, cash checkout with discount |
| **History** (cashier) | Own orders newest-first, live status bar, receipt/PDF, reorder |

### Filtering the dashboard by cashier

The Owner/Manager can scope the whole dashboard to one cashier. The selector is
populated from user records and matches on the cashier's **user id**, never the
display name, so two cashiers sharing a name cannot have their histories merged.
KPIs, the sales chart, best sellers and recent orders all follow the selection
together with the date range. Cancelled orders still contribute nothing.

### The period picker

Dashboard and Reports share one control (`RangePicker`), so they behave identically:

| Choice | Chart buckets |
|---|---|
| Today | **by hour** — `12am, 1am, …` |
| Last 7 days | by day |
| Last 30 days | by day |
| Custom range | by day, from/to date pickers for any past dates |

Choosing today (including via Custom) switches to hourly automatically. KPIs and percentage deltas follow the same window, comparing against the immediately preceding period of equal length. Empty buckets render as real zeroes rather than being squeezed out of the axis.

## Business rules

| Rule | Where it's enforced |
|---|---|
| Cart quantity is 1–99 | `parseQty` clamps typed input; `QuantityStepper` disables at the bounds; store clamps; `orderSchema` rejects out-of-range |
| Sold-out items cannot be ordered | Client checks `available`; store rejects |
| Orders always start `pending` | `orderSchema` and the security rules both reject any other status at creation |
| Cancelled orders count as zero everywhere | `validOrders()` filters them out of all sales figures |
| Cancelled orders cannot be refunded | Refund function rejects them |
| Orders are never deleted | Cancelled or refunded, to preserve the sales record |
| Cashier sees only their own orders | Path scoping + security rules |
| Only admins change menu or order status | Security rules |
| Only admins approve refunds | Cloud Function re-reads the caller's role |
| Refunds never exceed what was paid | Atomic check in the refund function |
| Only admins create or disable accounts | Cloud Functions |
| A user cannot change their own role | `role` validation rule |
| Nobody self-promotes to admin | `role` validation rule, and there is no UI to do it |
| An admin cannot disable their own account | Guarded in the function and the UI |
| Discount applied at most once | Recomputed from line items, never accepted from the caller |
| Only one discount per order | `discountType` is a single enum; PWD and Senior are never combined (also satisfies the statutory ban) |
| No duplicate product name within a category | `findConflictingMenuItems` in `actions.js` add/update paths; existing duplicates listed for review only |
| An account with no valid role cannot sign in | `loginUser` refuses and signs out; `roleLabel` shows it as "Unknown" |
| A disabled account cannot sign in | `loginUser` checks `disabled`, backed by the auth custom claim |
| A print or PDF contains one transaction | `buildReceipt(order)` is a pure per-order function; `public/receipt.css` hides everything but the receipt element |

## Data model

Three top-level nodes. Full detail in `firebase_structure.md`.

```
users/<uid>                 name, email, role, createdAt, disabled?
menu/<itemId>               name, price, description, category, tag, image, available
orders/<customerId>/<id>    customerId, customerName, displayId, items{}, subtotal?,
                            discountType?, discountAmount?, total, paymentMethod,
                            cashTendered?, changeGiven?, refunds{}, refundedTotal?,
                            status, createdAt, note?
```

Every field marked `?` is optional, so orders written before a feature existed
still load and still appear in reports.

Three decisions worth knowing:

**Orders are nested under the customer id.** RTDB security rules don't cascade, and they can't filter per query result. A flat `/orders` collection would force a choice between "only admins can read it" and "every cashier reads everyone's orders". Nesting sidesteps both: a cashier reads `/orders/<ownUid>`, an admin reads the whole tree.

**Order items are a map keyed by menu item id**, not an array — RTDB returns objects, and the key gives O(1) lookup.

**Refunds are appended to the order, never written over it.** `orders/<id>/refunds/<refundId>` holds one record per refund with amount, reason, timestamp and the approving admin. No client can write there at all; only the Cloud Function's Admin SDK can, which is what makes the audit trail trustworthy. The order's own `total` and `createdAt` are never modified.

---

## Security model

Firebase Auth owns credentials; the RTDB stores no passwords. Access is decided by the database rules, not the UI.

| Resource | Public | Cashier | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|
| `menu` | read | read | read + write |
| `orders` | — | read/write own subtree | read + write all |
| `orders/…/refunds` | — | — | **no client access at all** |
| `users` | — | read/write own profile | read + write all |

Validation lives in the rules too: prices must be positive, order totals positive, item quantities 1–99, and an order's `customerId` must match the path it sits under.

Refunds are deliberately `".write": false` for every client. They can only be written by the Cloud Function's Admin SDK, which bypasses the rules — that is precisely what makes the refund record trustworthy, since no browser code can fabricate one.

**The rules are the security boundary.** Hiding a button in React protects nothing.

---

## Known gaps

Stated plainly rather than buried:

1. **Prices are still client-supplied.** The schema now recomputes subtotal, discount and total from the line items and rejects a mismatch, and the rules cap quantity at 1–99 — but nothing checks `items[].price` against the live menu. A modified client could send `price: 1` for a ₱80 drink. Closing this properly means computing orders server-side in a Cloud Function, which would move order creation off the current path. **Not acceptable once real money is involved; acceptable while payment is a mock.**

2. **Discount entitlement is not evidenced.** The 20% rate is now verified against RA 10754 Sec. 32(a)(1) and RA 7432 Sec. 5(a) as amended. What is missing is proof: the law requires the concession holder's name, ID number and TIN on the sales record before the discount can be claimed as a tax deduction, and the app stores only the discount type. The owner must decide whether to capture ID details — that is a privacy decision, not a code default. See `src/lib/discounts.js`.

3. **Cloud Functions are optional.** Refunds and cashier disabling now run through the Firebase client SDK and RTDB rules. The functions in `functions/` may remain unused or be removed; they are not a prerequisite.

4. **Admin self-demotion is blocked by rules.** An admin cannot change their own `role` (including self-demotion) via the database rules.><|end|><|start|>edit to=assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Edited system_summary.md (1 replacement)

5. **No integration or emulator tests.** The pure logic is covered by 200 unit tests, but the Cloud Functions and the security rules are only verified by compiling and by manual browser checks against the live database.

6. **Orders never paginate properly.** The board caps at 100 rows and says so; older orders are still reachable by search.

7. **No offline support.** Losing connection mid-shift means losing the cart and failing checkouts.

8. **No four-digit PIN login.** Scoped and then deliberately dropped. A 4-digit PIN is only 10,000 values, so it is only defensible with a salted scrypt hash held in a rules-locked node read solely by the Admin SDK, per-account lockout, and an IP throttle — and every one of those would need deploying to be verified. No UI was added. The design, if wanted later: `pinCredentials/<uid>` denied to all clients, `setCashierPin` callable by the signed-in owner of the PIN, `pinLogin` issuing a Firebase session only after server-side verification, `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5` then a 5-minute lockout, and admins excluded. Email/password stays the only method today.

## Accounts

No credentials are stored in this repository. Staff accounts come from three
places:

| Source | Resulting role |
|---|---|
| Provisioned manually in Firebase Console | `cashier` |
| Created by an Owner/Manager at `/admin/cashiers` | `cashier` |
| Hand-edited in the Firebase console | `admin` — the only way to make an administrator |

New accounts register at `/register` with the `cashier` role. An Owner/Manager can
also create cashier accounts from `/admin/cashiers`, which goes through a Cloud
Function because creating another user's sign-in needs the Admin SDK. Promoting
someone to `admin` has to be done by hand in the Firebase console — the rules
deliberately prevent the app from granting it.

## Fix log (batch 1 — 6, 9, 10, 11)
- 6 Category: unified `CATEGORIES` export in `types.js`; used in Menu + Order filters.
- 9 Cart counter: `cartQtyMap` + `Badge` on menu cards (`Order.jsx`).
- 10 Stray `₱0`: receipt filters qty > 0; `cashTendered`/`changeGiven` guarded > 0; `receipt.css` unchanged.
- 11 Chart: `Area type="linear"` in Dashboard.

## Fix log (batch 2 — 1, 2, 5, 8)
- 1 Auth: removed `/register` route file (`src/pages/auth/Register.jsx`); `App.jsx` had no route.
- 2 Reorder: removed "Order again" button from `History.jsx`; `AppStore` reorder keeps current menu price/availability checks.
- 5 Orders: added historical price to item list in `Orders.jsx` (`peso(i.price)`).
- 8 Customizations: added quick tap buttons (prep + add-ons) above note input in checkout dialog (`Order.jsx`).
- 6 Category: unified `CATEGORIES` export in `types.js`; used in Menu + Order filters.
- 9 Cart counter: `cartQtyMap` + `Badge` on menu cards (`Order.jsx`).
- 10 Stray `₱0`: receipt filters qty > 0; `cashTendered`/`changeGiven` guarded > 0; `receipt.css` unchanged.
- 11 Chart: `Area type="linear"` in Dashboard.

## Test instructions
- Open `/order`, filter by category, verify no mismatch; add items, verify badge appears.
- Open receipt dialog / print; check no `₱0` on empty/change lines.
- Open `/admin` dashboard; verify 7-day line is straight, not curved over zero days.
- No commits or pushes made.

Static build — any static host works (Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify).

```bash
npm run build               # → dist/ (static frontend)
npm run deploy:rules        # publish database.rules.json
npm run deploy:functions    # build + deploy the Cloud Functions
```

The frontend is a static bundle and can go on any static host. The two deploy
commands are separate and both are required — the static build alone will not
make refunds or account management work.

Set the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` environment variables on the host; see `.env.example`. Because the values are baked in at build time, rebuild when they change.

Editing `database.rules.json` locally changes nothing until it is published.
