# CuccuPOS — Firebase Realtime Database Structure

## Overview

This document describes the Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB) data model and security rules for the CuccuPOS system. It replaces the current mock `localStorage` layer (`src/store/AppStore.jsx`) with a real backend while keeping the same data contracts (documented as JSDoc typedefs in `src/types.js`).

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Firebase Auth for authentication** | Passwords are never stored in the database. Firebase Auth handles email/password sign-in, and the RTDB stores only profile data. |
| **Users keyed by Firebase Auth UID** | The `users` node uses the Firebase Auth UID as the key, not a custom ID. This simplifies security rules and avoids a separate lookup. |
| **Orders keyed by customer, then push ID** | `/orders/<customerId>/<pushId>`. Nesting by customer is what lets a cashier read only their own orders under non-cascading RTDB rules. A client-generated `displayId` (`ORD-…`) is stored alongside for staff to read out. |
| **Menu is publicly readable** | Customers browse the menu before logging in. Only admins can modify it. |
| **Order items stored as a map** | RTDB handles objects better than arrays. Each item is keyed by `menuItemId` for O(1) lookup. |
| **No cascading deletes** | Orders are never deleted — they are cancelled (status change) to preserve sales records. |
| **Void requests live on the order** | `voidRequest`, `voidHistory` and the `pending_void` status are written only by Cloud Functions. See `void_workflow.md`. |

## Node Details

### `users/<uid>`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Display name |
| `email` | string | Email (for display; Firebase Auth handles actual auth) |
| `role` | `"cashier"` \| `"admin"` | Role-based access control. `admin` is the owner/manager; `cashier` takes orders at the counter. |
| `createdAt` | string (ISO 8601) | Account creation timestamp |

> **Note:** The `password` field from the current mock `User` type is intentionally omitted. Firebase Auth manages credentials. The `email` here is for display and profile lookup only.

### `menu/<itemId>`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Item name |
| `price` | number | Price in PHP (must be > 0) |
| `description` | string | Short description |
| `category` | `"Coffee"` \| `"Milk Tea"` \| `"Frappe"` \| `"Others"` | Menu category |
| `tag` | string \| null | Optional badge (e.g. `"Non-coffee"` for Others category) |
| `image` | string \| null | Path or URL to item image |
| `available` | boolean | Whether the item can be ordered |

### `orders/<customerId>/<pushId>`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `customerId` | string | Firebase Auth UID of the customer. Redundant with the path by design: the rules cross-check the two so a mismatched body is rejected, and admin views read the field without a lookup. |
| `customerName` | string | Denormalized for display (avoids a join) |
| `displayId` | string | Human-readable order number, e.g. `ORD-MJ2K9XQ` |
| `items` | map | Order line items keyed by `menuItemId` |
| `total` | number | Order total in PHP |
| `paymentMethod` | `"Cash"` \| `"GCash"` \| `"Card"` | Payment method |
| `status` | `"pending"` \| `"preparing"` \| `"ready"` \| `"completed"` \| `"cancelled"` | Order status |
| `createdAt` | string (ISO 8601) | Order placement timestamp |
| `note` | string \| null | Optional kitchen note |

#### `orders/<customerId>/<pushId>/items/<menuItemId>`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `menuItemId` | string | Reference to `menu/<itemId>` |
| `name` | string | Denormalized item name at time of order |
| `price` | number | Denormalized price at time of order |
| `qty` | number | Quantity (1–99) |
| `category` | string | Denormalized category |

### `orders/<customerId>/<pushId>/displayId`

A human-readable order number generated on the client at creation time, e.g.
`ORD-MJ2K9XQ`. It exists purely so staff can read an order number over the counter;
the push key remains the real identifier.

---

## Deploying these rules

The rules live in **`database.rules.json`** at the repo root (the source of truth).
The copy below is kept for reference. Deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy:rules      # firebase deploy --only database
```

A local file edit does **not** change the deployed rules — the console must be
published (or the command above run) for anything here to take effect.

---

## Security Rules

> **Why orders are nested under the customer id.** RTDB rules do **not** cascade
> downward, and they cannot be written per-result for a query. A `.read` on
> `/orders/$orderId` does **not** grant read on `/orders`, so a flat `/orders`
> collection forces an all-or-nothing choice: either only admins can read the
> collection (cashiers see nothing), or everyone reads everyone's orders.
> Storing orders at `/orders/<customerId>/<orderId>` avoids the conflict — a
> cashier reads `/orders/<ownUid>` via the child rule, an admin reads all of
> `/orders` via the parent rule, and neither can reach the other's data.

          "refundedTotal": {
            ".validate": "!newData.exists() || (newData.isNumber() && newData.val() >= 0)"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Why `orders/.../refunds` is unwritable from any client

`".write": false` means the **Admin SDK in a Cloud Function is the only writer** —
the rules are bypassed by `firebase-admin`, which is exactly why the refund
transaction can be trusted. No browser client, however modified, can fabricate a
refund or inflate `refundedTotal`.

---

## Backend functions

No Cloud Functions are used. Privileged operations are handled through the
Realtime Database rules and client-side transactions.

Deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy:functions
```

**Until these are deployed, the refund and account-management buttons will report
that they are unavailable.** They will not simulate success or imply that cash was
returned.

> `.validate` cascades to descendants, which is why `items` is nested under the
> order and validated without repeating the parent check. `.read` and `.write`
> are the opposite — they never cascade, which is the whole reason the structure
> above nests by customer.

> `.indexOn` is intentionally absent: with orders nested under the customer id, a
> server-side `orderByChild` would compare whole customers instead of individual
> orders. The admin UI already receives every order and filters in memory, and a
> cashier only ever reads their own small set.

### Why `set`, not `update`, for single values

Firebase v9+ rejects `update(ref, value)` unless `value` is an object
(`values argument must be an object containing the children to replace`).
Single-field writes such as an order's `status` or a menu item's `available` use
`set()` in `src/lib/actions.js`.

### Why there is no `counters` node

The first draft generated `displayId` (`ORD-1001`) from a shared counter at
`/counters/orders`. That cannot be made safe: a customer must read the counter to
increment it, and granting every customer write access to a shared counter lets one
customer reset everyone's order numbers. The order number is now generated on the
client from a timestamp (`makeDisplayId()` in `src/lib/actions.js`), which needs no
extra permissions and stays unique and sortable. If you later move order creation to
a Cloud Function, that function can own a counter safely.

### Privilege escalation guard

A user may write their own profile, so without help they could set their own
`role` to `admin` and inherit every admin capability. The `role` `.validate` rule
above pins it to `cashier` unless the writer is *already* an admin. The `email`
field is likewise locked to the caller's own auth token email.

> **Known gap:** this does not stop an admin from changing *their own* role, so a
> mis-click in a future role-management screen could demote the only admin and
> lock the shop out of its dashboard (the app would then be reachable only by
> editing `users/<uid>/role` in the Firebase console). If you add a role editor,
> either disable the control on your own row in the UI or extend the rule with a
> `auth.uid === $uid` branch that requires the role to be unchanged.

## Security Rules Explained

### `users/<uid>`

| Operation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Read (parent)** | Only admins can read the whole `users` node (needed for the Users page). |
| **Read (child)** | A user can read their own profile. An admin can read any profile. |
| **Write** | A user can create/update their own profile. An admin can create/update any profile. |
| **Validate** | Must have `name`, `email`, `role`, and `createdAt`. `role` is pinned to `cashier` unless the writer is already an admin, and `email` is pinned to the caller's own auth token. |

### `menu/<itemId>`

| Operation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Read** | **Public** — anyone (including unauthenticated visitors) can read the menu. |
| **Write** | Only admins can add, edit, or delete menu items. |
| **Validate** | Must have `name`, `price`, `description`, `category`, and `available` fields. |

### `orders/<customerId>/<orderId>`

| Operation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Read (parent)** | Only admins can read the whole `orders` node. |
| **Read (subtree)** | A customer can read `/orders/<their own uid>`. An admin can read anyone's. |
| **Write (create)** | An authenticated user can create an order under their own uid, and the body's `customerId` **must** equal that uid with `status` `pending`. |
| **Write (update)** | Only admins can update an existing order (e.g. status `pending` → `preparing`). |
| **Write (delete)** | Only admins can delete an order (though the app uses status `cancelled` instead of deletion). |
| **Validate** | Must have `customerId`, `customerName`, `items`, `total`, `paymentMethod`, `status`, and `createdAt`. `customerId` must match the path, `total` must be a positive number, and each item's `qty` must be 1–99. |

---

## Business Rules Enforced

| Business Rule | How It's Enforced |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Cart quantity clamped to 1–99 | `parseQty` in `QuantityStepper` clamps typed and stepped values; `setQty` in `AppStore` clamps again; `orderSchema` in `actions.js` rejects out-of-range values. Server-side: `.validate` on order items requires `qty` 1–99. |
| No duplicate product names | `findConflictingMenuItems` in `src/lib/duplicates.js`, enforced in `addMenuItem`/`updateMenuItem` so a non-UI caller cannot bypass it. Matching is by normalized name **and** category (case, surrounding and repeated whitespace folded). Existing duplicates are listed for admin review and never auto-merged or deleted. |
| Sold-out items can't be ordered | Client-side check in `addToCart`. Server-side: validate `menu/<id>/available` is `true` at order creation (requires a Cloud Function for full enforcement). |
| Orders start as `pending` | Client sets `status: "pending"` on create. |
| Cancelled orders excluded from sales | `validOrders()` in `src/lib/stats.js` filters out `status === "cancelled"`. |
| Only admins can change order status | Security rules: only admins can update existing orders. |
| Customers only see their own orders | Orders are nested at `/orders/<customerId>/`, so a cashier's read of their own subtree is the only one the rules grant them. |
| Passwords are never stored in DB | Firebase Auth handles authentication. The `users` node contains no password field. |
| Only `cashier` or `admin` are valid roles | `role` `.validate` in `database.rules.json`; `loginUser` in `actions.js` refuses to sign in a profile whose role is missing or unrecognised; `roleLabel` in `src/lib/roles.js` shows such an account as "Unknown" rather than mislabelling it. |
| Disabled accounts cannot sign in | `loginUser` rejects a profile with `disabled === true` and signs the session back out. |
| Refunds are Owner/Manager-only and appended atomically | `refundOrder` Cloud Function re-reads the caller's role, then runs a transaction on the order. `orders/*/*/refunds` has `".write": false` in the rules, so no client can write one. |

---

## Indexes

**None are required.** Every database read the app performs is an unfiltered path read —
`onValue(/menu)`, `onValue(/orders)`, `onValue(/orders/<uid>)`, `get(/users/<uid>)` — and
those never need an index.

`src/lib/actions.js` still contains `getMenuItemByName` and `getMenuItemsByCategory`, which
use `orderByChild` and *would* need `.indexOn: ["name"]` and `.indexOn: ["category"]` under
`menu`. Both are dead code: no page calls them, because the UI filters the already-loaded
menu client-side instead.

They are also wrong to wire up as-is. With orders nested under a customer id, a server-side
`orderByChild` at `/orders` compares whole cashiers rather than individual orders, which is
why no `.indexOn` appears in `database.rules.json`. If those helpers are ever revived, add
the two indexes under `menu` at the same time.

---

## Re-seeding / Resetting

The frontend is already wired to Firebase, so there is no migration left to do.

**Menu** — import the Sample Data below into Realtime Database → Data. `/menu` is
publicly readable, so this needs no special rules.

**Demo accounts** — create the sign-ins from `/register` in the app (which writes
`role: "cashier"` correctly through the rules), then promote the owner/manager by
hand, because only an admin may write an `admin` role and nobody can grant it to
themselves:

```
Realtime Database → Data → users/<uid>/role → "admin"
```

Demo data reset helpers have been removed; manage seed data directly in the console if needed.
