# CuccuPOS Frontend

React (JavaScript) + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui, backed by **Firebase** (Auth + Realtime Database + Cloud Functions).

## Run it
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # type-check + production build
npm test           # unit tests (Vitest)
```

## Configuration
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Firebase web app values:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=
```
Security rules, the data structure, and the seeding steps live in [`docs/firebase_structure.md`](docs/firebase_structure.md).

## Deploying the backend

These operations live in Cloud Functions under `functions/`:

| Function | Why |
|---|---|
| `refundOrder` | Refund validation must be atomic, and the approving admin must come from the verified session |
| `createCashier` | Creating another user's sign-in account needs the Admin SDK |
| `setCashierEnabled` | Disabling an account also needs the Admin SDK, and doesn't cascade to the database |
| `requestVoid` / `approveVoid` / `declineVoid` | The void trail must be written from the verified session; clients are blocked from writing it |

```bash
npm run deploy:rules      # publish database.rules.json
npm run deploy:functions  # build + deploy functions/
npm run emulators         # local Auth + RTDB + Functions
```

**Refunds and cashier account management do not work until the functions are deployed.** The same applies to the void request workflow ([`void_workflow.md`](void_workflow.md)). The UI says so plainly instead of pretending the action succeeded.

Deployment uses the Firebase CLI's own login (`firebase login`) — there is no service-account key in this repository, and none is needed. The browser SDK's API key is public by design; access is controlled by `database.rules.json`.

## Accounts

Staff accounts are created by an Owner/Manager from `/admin/cashiers`, or by
signing up at `/register` — new sign-ups get the **cashier** role. The first
administrator has to be promoted by hand in the Firebase console
(`users/<uid>/role` → `admin`); the app deliberately provides no way to do it.

No credentials are committed to this repository.

## Routes
Only staff sign in — customers are walk-ins and never get accounts.

| Path | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| `/login`, `/register` | public | Auth |
| `/order` | cashier | Browse menu, cart with typed quantity, cash checkout with discount and change |
| `/history` | cashier | Own orders, live status, receipt/PDF, order again |
| `/admin/dashboard` | owner/manager | KPIs + sales chart + best sellers, filterable by cashier |
| `/admin/orders` | owner/manager | Order board, status flow, cancel, refund, receipt/PDF |
| `/admin/menu` | owner/manager | Add/edit/delete items, sold-out toggle, duplicate review |
| `/admin/cashiers` | owner/manager | Staff list with roles, create account, disable access |
| `/admin/reports` | owner/manager | Period report, gross/refunds/net, CSV, print |

## Roles
| Value in DB | Shown as | Can do |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| `admin` | Owner/Manager | Everything, including menu, refunds and reports |
| `cashier` | Cashier | Take orders, record cash, apply discounts, see own history |

The `role` values live in `users/<uid>/role` and are enforced by the security
rules in `database.rules.json`. There is deliberately no way to promote an
account to `admin` from the UI. A profile with a missing or unrecognised role
is refused at sign-in rather than being coerced into a valid one.

## Not implemented: four-digit PIN login

A cashier PIN was scoped and then **deliberately left out**. A four-digit PIN has only
10,000 possible values, so making it usable without weakening the design would need a
salted server-side hash under Admin SDK, per-account lockout, and a rules change to
lock the credential node — plus deployment to verify any of it. Since none of that could
be tested here, shipping a UI shortcut would have meant shipping an untested
credential. Email and password remain the only sign-in method. See "Outstanding issues"
in `system_summary.md` for the design if it is picked up later.

## Where the data lives
`src/lib/actions.js` holds **every** database and auth call and returns
`{ success, message, data }` for mutations. Pages never touch Firebase directly —
they go through `useStore()` from `src/store/AppStore.jsx`, which keeps React
state in sync via `onValue` listeners and hands orders over newest-first.

Pure logic lives in modules with no Firebase dependency: `stats.js` (date ranges,
bucketing, sorting), `discounts.js` (discount maths), `finance.js` (gross /
refunds / net). These are what the test suite covers.

Types are in `src/types.js` and double as the API contract. Zod schemas in
`actions.js` recompute and reject any monetary value that doesn't reconcile.

## Business rules in the UI
- Cart quantity is clamped to **1–99**. It can be typed directly into the cart; Enter or leaving the field commits it, Escape reverts, and a cleared field never deletes the line. The trash icon removes an item.
- Sold-out items can't be added to the cart.
- Checkout is still a mock payment: a short "processing" step, then the order is created as `pending`. No external payment system is contacted.
- PWD and Senior Citizen discounts are selectable at checkout. The **20% rate is the statutory minimum** under RA 10754 Sec. 32(a) (PWD) and RA 7432 Sec. 5(a) as amended (Senior Citizen), both of which cover a coffee shop. What the app does **not** do is verify or record ID proof, which the law requires to claim the discount as a tax deduction — see the header of `src/lib/discounts.js`.
- Refunds are partial-capable, never exceed what was paid, and keep the original order intact.
- Cancelled orders are excluded from all sales figures and cannot be refunded.
- A cashier only ever reads their own orders; only an admin can change order status, refund, or edit the menu.
- Nobody can edit their own role, and an admin cannot disable their own account.
- Menu items can't share a name within a category. Existing duplicates are listed for review and never merged or deleted automatically.
- Every transaction can be printed or downloaded as a PDF from the admin order board and from a cashier's history. A print contains that one transaction and nothing else.

## Testing
```bash
npm test         # 200 unit tests
npm run test:tz  # re-runs them across four timezones
```
Covers date-range boundaries and ordering, timezone handling, order sorting,
discount and change arithmetic, refund validation, cashier filtering, receipt
data selection and filenames, duplicate-product matching, and quantity parsing.

## Assets
- Put drink photos in `public/menu/` using the file names in `src/data/seed.js`. A placeholder shows if one is missing.
- Swap the placeholder logo in `src/components/Logo.jsx` for your real mark.
- Theme colours are CSS variables at the top of `src/index.css`.
