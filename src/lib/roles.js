/**
 * Display helpers for the two staff roles.

 * The database stores the raw value ("admin" / "cashier"); these are the labels the
 * UI shows. Kept in one place so a role is never described two different ways in two
 * different screens.
 *
 * `roleLabel` deliberately returns "Unknown" for anything unrecognised rather than
 * defaulting to "Cashier". Showing an account with a missing or corrupt role as a
 * cashier would quietly mislabel a real administrator — the QA spec calls this out
 * specifically.
