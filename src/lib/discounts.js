/**
 * Discount rules for PWD and Senior Citizen.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERIFIED AGAINST PRIMARY SOURCES (checked October 2026)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The 20% rate is not a guess. It is the statutory minimum for both concessions:
 *
 *   - PWD: RA 10754 Sec. 32(a) grants "at least twenty percent (20%) discount and
 *     exemption from the value-added tax (VAT), if applicable", and 32(a)(1)
 *     explicitly covers "restaurants and recreation centers". The IRR of RA 9442
 *     Sec. 6.1(b) extends this to a restaurant's "food drinks, beverages, dessert
 *     and other consumable items served by the establishments including value
 *     meals and other similar food counters, fast food, cooked food and short
 *     orders including take-outs" — which covers a coffee shop's drinks. The rule is
 *     a floor, not a cap: a business may grant more.
 *   - Senior Citizen: RA 7432 Sec. 5(a), as amended by RA 9994 and restated in
 *     RA 11916, grants the same 20% discount plus VAT exemption.
 *
 * Two statutory rules the code deliberately does NOT implement, because both are
 * operational/legal decisions for the owner, not software defaults:
 *
 *   - NO DOUBLE DISCOUNTING. RA 10754 IRR Sec. 12 and the DOT/DTI circulars state
 *     that a person who is both PWD and senior may use EITHER ID for the single
 *     20% discount, never both. This module enforces one discount per order, so
 *     the prohibition holds by construction.
 *   - PROMOTIONAL DISCOUNTS. Where an establishment already runs a promo, the
 *     buyer takes whichever is more favourable, not both. This app has no promo
 *     engine, so there is nothing to reconcile today; revisit if promos are added.
 *
 * Note this app discounts the full pre-VAT amount and does not model VAT at all.
 * VAT exemption is a separate BIR bookkeeping matter for the owner.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STILL UNRESOLVED — confirm with the business owner before launch
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. ELIGIBILITY / PROOF OF ID. The law conditions the concession on proof of
 *    entitlement: a PWD ID, barangay/city ID or passport, and a senior citizen ID.
 *    RA 10754 IRR Sec. 12 further requires that the establishment's sales records
 *    carry the concession holder's NAME, ID NUMBER and TIN if the discount is
 *    claimed as a tax deduction. This application records none of that: the
 *    cashier asserts eligibility and only the discount type is stored on the
 *    order. Collecting and retaining ID details is a policy and privacy decision
 *    for the owner, and the app must not be described as compliant until it is.
 * 2. SCOPE. The discount is applied to the whole food subtotal, which assumes every
 *    item is eligible. RA 10754 does restrict use to "the exclusive use and
 *    enjoyment" of the buyer. If any item should be excluded, list its category in
 *    `ELIGIBLE_CATEGORIES` below.
 * 3. STACKING. Only one discount applies per order; PWD and Senior are never
 *    combined. This matches the statute, so it is a rule rather than an open
 *    question.
 *
 * All monetary values are PHP pesos.
